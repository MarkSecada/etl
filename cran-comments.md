## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.1
* local Ubuntu 14.04, R 3.3.1
* Ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.2.5
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* Code coverage is 85%.
* I believe this will fix the error reported here (https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang/etl-00check.html). I checked this
with r-hub on Fedora and found no errors. 

## Reverse dependencies

`macleish` and `mdsr` have both been checked.
